# Mobility Patterns of University Commuters
This study examines the link between occupation and transport choices among university commuters using survey data. Python is used for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, including the Chi-Square Test of Independence, to explore mobility patterns and assess occupation’s influence on transport modes.

# Features
Survey-based dataset capturing transport choices

Occupation-based categorization of respondents

Chi-Square Test of Independence for statistical significance

Visualization of mobility trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Insights for university transport planning and optimization

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
SciPy

# Dataset

The dataset used in this study was collected via a university survey, capturing different modes of transport used during term time. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy before analysis.
